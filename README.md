# LogAnalyzer
This is a C project I created to analyze and calculate the expected outcome of a simulation.
It and gives you details like:

1. The expected Heart Beat for Zigbee based network devices. 
2. The total duration of the test in either a 12 hour clock or 24 hour.


This setup comprises of End devices or Routers that send Heart Beat messages indicating thier presence in the Network.
